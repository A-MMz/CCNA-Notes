# 2 Basic Switch and End Device Configuration
## 2.2 IOS Navigation
### 2.2.1 Primary Command Modes
#### User EXEC mode:
* Mode allows access to only a limited number of basic monitoring commands (examples?)
* It is often referred to as “view-only" mode.
* identified by the CLI prompt that ends with the **>** symbol.
```
hostName>
Switch>
Router>
```
#### Privileged EXEC Mode:
* Mode allows access to all commands and features.
* The user can use any monitoring commands and execute configuration and management commands.
* identified by the prompt ending with the **#** symbol
```
hostName#
Switch#
Router#
```
### 2.2.1 Configuration Mode and Subconfigaration Modes
To configure the device, the user must enter global configuration mode, which is commonly called global config mode.
Global configuration mode is accessed before other specific configuration modes(examples?). 

From global config mode, the user can enter different subconfiguration modes. Each of these modes allows the configuration of a particular part or function of the IOS device. Two common subconfiguration modes include:

* **Line Configuration Mode** - Used to configure console, SSH, Telnet, or AUX access.
* **Interface Configuration Mode** - Used to configure a switch port or router network interface.

The mode is identified by the command-line prompt that is unique to that mode. By default, every prompt begins with the device name. Following the name, the remainder of the prompt indicates the mode.

Line configuration:
```
Switch(config-line)# 
```
Interface configuration:
```
Switch(config-if)#
```
Example of command flow for entering *Line Configuration Mode* and *Interface Configuration Mode* for a Switch :
```ssh
Switch>enable
Switch#
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End wot CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#
Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)#
Switch(config-line)#exit
Switch(config)#
Switch(config)#interface vlan 1
Switch(config-if)#
Switch(config-if)#line vty 0 15
Switch(config-line)#
Switch(config-line)#end
Switch#
%SYS-%-CONFIG_i: Configured from console by console

Switch#
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End wot CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#
Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)#
Switch(config-line)#^Z
Switch#
%SYS-%-CONFIG_i: Configured from console by console

Switch#
```

When a command output produces more text than can be displayed in a terminal window, the IOS will display a “--More--” prompt. The following table describes the keystrokes that can be used when this prompt is displayed.

|Keystroke            |Description |
|---------------------|------------|
|Enter Key            |Displays the next line.|
|Space Bar            |Displays the next screen.|
|Any other key *      |Ends the display string, returning to previous prompt. * Except "y", which answers "yes" to the --More-- prompt, and acts like the Space bar|

This table lists commands used to exit out of an operation.

|Keystroke            |Description |
|---------------------|------------|
|Ctrl-C               |When in any configuration mode, ends the configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode. When in setup mode, aborts back to the command prompt.|
|Ctrl-Z               |When in any configuration mode, ends the configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode.|
|Ctrl-Shift-6         |All-purpose break sequence used to abort DNS lookups, traceroutes, pings, etc.|

## 2.4 Basic Device Configuration
### 2.4.1 Device Names
#### Naming guidelines for hosts:
* Start with a letter
* Contain no spaces
* End with a letter or digit
* Use only letters, digits, and dashes
* Be less than 64 characters in length

Commands:
```
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# hostname Sw-Floor-1
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
```
To return the switch to the default prompt, use the **no hostname global** config command.

### 2.4.2-3 Passwords
* Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
* Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences.
* Avoid using the same password for all devices.
* Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.

To secure user EXEC mode access, enter line console configuration mode using the line console 0 global configuration command.

The zero is used to represent the first (and in most cases the only) console interface.

Commands:
```
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)# password cisco
Switch(config-line)# login
Switch(config-line)# end
Switch#
```

To secure privileged EXEC access, use the enable secret password global config command.

Commands:
```
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# enable secret class
Switch(config)# exit
Switch#
```

Virtual terminal (VTY) lines enable remote access using Telnet or SSH to the device. Many Cisco switches support up to 16 VTY lines that are numbered 0 to 15.

Commands:

```
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# line vty 0 15
Switch(config-line)# password cisco 
Switch(config-line)# login 
Switch(config-line)# end
Switch#
```


The startup-config and running-config files display most passwords in plaintext. This is a security threat because anyone can discover the passwords if they have access to these files.

To encrypt all plaintext passwords, use the service password-encryption global config command as shown in the example.
```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# service password-encryption
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
```
Configure the banner on Sw-Floor-1 commands:
```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# banner motd #Authorized Access Only#
```

## 2.5 Save Configurations
### 2.5.1 Configuration Files
There are two system files that store the device configuration:

* startup-config - This is the saved configuration file that is stored in NVRAM. It contains all the commands that will be used by the device upon startup or reboot. Flash does not lose its contents when the device is powered off.
* running-config - This is stored in Random Access Memory (RAM). It reflects the current configuration. Modifying a running configuration affects the operation of a Cisco device immediately. RAM is volatile memory. It loses all of its content when the device is powered off or restarted.

The **show running-config** privileged EXEC mode command is used to view the running config.The command will list the complete configuration currently stored in RAM.
```
show running-config
```

If power to the device is lost, or if the device is restarted, all configuration changes will be lost unless they have been saved. To save changes made to the running configuration to the startup configuration file, use the **copy running-config startup-config** privileged EXEC mode command.
```
copy running-config startup-config
```
### 2.5.2 Alter the Running Configuration

If changes made to the running config do not have the desired effect and the running-config has not yet been saved, you can restore the device to its previous configuration.
```
reload
```
The downside to using the **reload** command to remove an unsaved running config is the brief amount of time the device will be offline, causing network downtime.

Alternatively, if undesired changes were saved to the startup config, it may be necessary to clear all the configurations. This requires erasing the startup config and restarting the device. The startup config is removed by using the **erase startup-config privileged** EXEC mode command. After the command is issued, the switch will prompt you for confirmation. Press Enter to accept.
```
erase startup-config privileged
```

### 2.5.4 Capture Configuration to a Text File

## 2.7 Configure IP Addressing
### 2.7.4 Switch Virtual Interface Configuration
To access the switch remotely, an IP address and a subnet mask must be configured on the SVI.

 Switches configured with an IPv4 address will typically also need to have a default gateway assigned.
```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# interface vlan 1
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.20 255.255.255.0
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# no shutdown
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# exit
Sw-Floor-1(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
```
